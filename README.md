# N-Sharp

## Introduction
N-Sharp is a custom programming language I made because I don't like c++ very much (N-Sharp's interpreter is written in c++ though). N-Sharp scripts have the file extension .NS. The base syntax and formatting I would say is quite similar to C# or Python, but differs as task complexity increases. It also has support for graphics using SDL2.

Will be working on documentation later on!!!
